This information you find here was extracted by the following authors:
Athey and Wager in 2018. Also, the code contains part of the casual tree which
was developed by erikcs in Github from beginning and throughout.

Here I leave his github page:
[erikcs](https://github.com/grf-labs/grf/tree/master/experiments/acic18)


Importing the main libraries
```{r}
set.seed(1)

rm(list = ls())

library(grf)
if(packageVersion("grf") < '0.10.2') {
  warning("This script requires grf 0.10.2 or higher")
}
library(sandwich)
library(lmtest)
library(Rcpp)
library(Hmisc)
library(devtools)
library(ggplot2)
```


Loading data
```{r}
data.all = read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grf-labs/grf/master/experiments/acic18/synthetic_data.csv"))

data.all$schoolid = factor(data.all$schoolid)

DF = data.all[,-1]
school.id = as.numeric(data.all$schoolid)

school.mat = model.matrix(~ schoolid + 0, data = data.all)
school.size = colSums(school.mat)

```


#In this part the school ID does not affect pscore. So  I am going to ignore it
```{r}
w.lm = glm(Z ~ ., data = data.all[,-3], family = binomial)
summary(w.lm)

W = DF$Z
Y = DF$Y
X.raw = DF[,-(1:2)]

C1.exp = model.matrix(~ factor(X.raw$C1) + 0)
XC.exp = model.matrix(~ factor(X.raw$XC) + 0)

X = cbind(X.raw[,-which(names(X.raw) %in% c("C1", "XC"))], C1.exp, XC.exp)

```


1. How the tree was built?
```{r}
Y.forest = regression_forest(X, Y, clusters = school.id, equalize.cluster.weights = TRUE)
Y.hat = predict(Y.forest)$predictions
W.forest = regression_forest(X, W, clusters = school.id, equalize.cluster.weights = TRUE)
W.hat = predict(W.forest)$predictions

cf.raw = causal_forest(X, Y, W,
                       Y.hat = Y.hat, W.hat = W.hat,
                       clusters = school.id,
                       equalize.cluster.weights = TRUE)
varimp = variable_importance(cf.raw)
selected.idx = which(varimp > mean(varimp))

cf = causal_forest(X[,selected.idx], Y, W,
                   Y.hat = Y.hat, W.hat = W.hat,
                   clusters = school.id,
                   equalize.cluster.weights = TRUE,
                   tune.parameters = "all")
tau.hat = predict(cf)$predictions

cf
```

In this first part, I can say the three was built according 2000 threes, the number of the train test was 10391 and the main  features were 8.


2. Estimating the ATE
```{r}
ATE = average_treatment_effect(cf)
paste("95% CI for the ATE:", round(ATE[1], 3),
      "+/-", round(qnorm(0.975) * ATE[2], 3))

```

In the part number two, I can say the 95% CI for the ATE is around the 0.248 +/- 0.04.

3. Run best linear predictor analysis
```{r}
test_calibration(cf)
```

In the part number three, I can say the variable mean.forest.prediction is significant because its p-value is less than 0.05, but the differential.forest.prediction is not significant because the p-value is more than 0.05.


```{r}
dr.score = tau.hat + W / cf$W.hat *
  (Y - cf$Y.hat - (1 - cf$W.hat) * tau.hat) -
  (1 - W) / (1 - cf$W.hat) * (Y - cf$Y.hat + cf$W.hat * tau.hat)
school.score = t(school.mat) %*% dr.score / school.size

school.X1 = t(school.mat) %*% X$X1 / school.size
high.X1 = school.X1 > median(school.X1)
t.test(school.score[high.X1], school.score[!high.X1])

school.X2 = (t(school.mat) %*% X$X2) / school.size
high.X2 = school.X2 > median(school.X2)
t.test(school.score[high.X2], school.score[!high.X2])

school.X2.levels = cut(school.X2,
  breaks = c(-Inf, quantile(school.X2, c(1/3, 2/3)), Inf))
summary(aov(school.score ~ school.X2.levels))

school.score.XS3.high = t(school.mat) %*% (dr.score * (X$S3 >= 6)) /
  t(school.mat) %*% (X$S3 >= 6)
school.score.XS3.low = t(school.mat) %*% (dr.score * (X$S3 < 6)) /
  t(school.mat) %*% (X$S3 < 6)

plot(school.score.XS3.low, school.score.XS3.high)
t.test(school.score.XS3.high - school.score.XS3.low)

```


4. Look at school-wise heterogeneity
```{r}
pdf("school_hist.pdf")
pardef = par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.main=1.5, cex.sub=1.5)
hist(school.score, xlab = "School Treatment Effect Estimate", main = "")
dev.off()
```

In the part number four, the graph of the distribution appears to follow a normal distribution since the data is more clustered in the center and there are few outliers.


5.Analysis ignoring clusters
```{r}
cf.noclust = causal_forest(X[,selected.idx], Y, W,
                           Y.hat = Y.hat, W.hat = W.hat,
                           tune.parameters = "all")

ATE.noclust = average_treatment_effect(cf.noclust)
paste("95% CI for the ATE:", round(ATE.noclust[1], 3),
      "+/-", round(qnorm(0.975) * ATE.noclust[2], 3))

test_calibration(cf.noclust)

tau.hat.noclust = predict(cf.noclust)$predict
plot(school.id, tau.hat.noclust)

nfold = 5
school.levels = unique(school.id)
cluster.folds = sample.int(nfold, length(school.levels), replace = TRUE)

tau.hat.crossfold = rep(NA, length(Y))
for (foldid in 1:nfold) {
  print(foldid)
  infold = school.id %in% school.levels[cluster.folds == foldid]
  cf.fold = causal_forest(X[!infold, selected.idx], Y[!infold], W[!infold],
                          Y.hat = Y.hat[!infold], W.hat = W.hat[!infold],
                          tune.parameters = "all")
  pred.fold = predict(cf.fold, X[infold, selected.idx])$predictions
  tau.hat.crossfold[infold] = pred.fold
}

cf.noclust.cpy = cf.noclust
cf.noclust.cpy$predictions = tau.hat.crossfold
cf.noclust.cpy$clusters = school.id
test_calibration(cf.noclust.cpy)

Rloss = mean(((Y - Y.hat) - tau.hat * (W - W.hat))^2)
Rloss.noclust = mean(((Y - Y.hat) - tau.hat.noclust * (W - W.hat))^2)
Rloss.crossfold = mean(((Y - Y.hat) - tau.hat.crossfold * (W - W.hat))^2)

c(Rloss.noclust - Rloss, Rloss.crossfold - Rloss)

summary(aov(dr.score ~ factor(school.id)))
```


In the five section, I can see the value of the mean forest prediction is 
significant because the p-value is less than 0.05 but the differential.forest.prediction doesnt has the case, the p-value is more than 0.05, which is non significant.


6. Analysis without fitting the propensity score
```{r}
cf.noprop = causal_forest(X[,selected.idx], Y, W,
                          Y.hat = Y.hat, W.hat = mean(W),
                          tune.parameters = "all",
                          equalize.cluster.weights = TRUE,
                          clusters = school.id)
tau.hat.noprop = predict(cf.noprop)$predictions

ATE.noprop = average_treatment_effect(cf.noprop)
paste("95% CI for the ATE:", round(ATE.noprop[1], 3),
      "+/-", round(qnorm(0.975) * ATE.noprop[2], 3))

pdf("tauhat_noprop.pdf")
pardef = par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.main=1.5, cex.sub=1.5)
plot(tau.hat, tau.hat.noprop,
     xlim = range(tau.hat, tau.hat.noprop),
     ylim = range(tau.hat, tau.hat.noprop),
     xlab = "orthogonalized causal forest estimates",
     ylab = "non-orthogonalized causal forest")
abline(0, 1, lwd = 2, lty = 2, col = 4)
par = pardef
dev.off()
```

In the section number 6, I can see in 95% CI for the ATE it is around 0.254 +/- 0.038. In the plot, I can see the linear regression is trying to go through the point. 

```{r}
school.X = (t(school.mat) %*% as.matrix(X[,c(4:8, 25:28)])) / school.size
school.X = data.frame(school.X)
colnames(school.X) = c("X1", "X2", "X3", "X4", "X5",
                    "XC.1", "XC.2", "XC.3", "XC.4")

dr.score = tau.hat + W / cf$W.hat * (Y - cf$Y.hat - (1 - cf$W.hat) * tau.hat) -
  (1 - W) / (1 - cf$W.hat) * (Y - cf$Y.hat + cf$W.hat * tau.hat)
school.score = t(school.mat) %*% dr.score / school.size

school.forest = regression_forest(school.X, school.score)
school.pred = predict(school.forest)$predictions
test_calibration(school.forest)


# Alternative OLS analysis
school.DF = data.frame(school.X, school.score=school.score)
coeftest(lm(school.score ~ ., data = school.DF), vcov = vcovHC)

```


7. The code plot six plots in the Make some plots section, so explain what you find there.
```{r}
pdf("tauhat_hist.pdf")
pardef = par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.main=1.5, cex.sub=1.5)
hist(tau.hat, xlab = "estimated CATE", main = "")
dev.off()

pdf("tauhat_hist_noprop.pdf")
pardef = par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.main=1.5, cex.sub=1.5)
hist(tau.hat.noprop, xlab = "estimated CATE", main = "")
dev.off()

pdf("tauhat_hist_noclust.pdf")
pardef = par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.main=1.5, cex.sub=1.5)
hist(tau.hat.noclust, xlab = "estimated CATE", main = "",
     breaks = seq(-0.0, 0.55, by = 0.55 / 25))
dev.off()


pdf("tauhat_vs_X1.pdf")
pardef = par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.main=1.5, cex.sub=1.5)
boxplot(tau.hat ~ round(X$X1), xlab = "X1", ylab = "estimated CATE")
lines(smooth.spline(4 + X[,"X1"], tau.hat, df = 4), lwd = 2, col = 4)
dev.off()

pdf("tauhat_vs_X2.pdf")
pardef = par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.main=1.5, cex.sub=1.5)
boxplot(tau.hat ~ round(X$X2), xlab = "X2", ylab = "estimated CATE")
lines(smooth.spline(4 + X[,"X2"], tau.hat, df = 4), lwd = 2, col = 4)
dev.off()

school.avg.tauhat = t(school.mat) %*% tau.hat / school.size

pdf("school_avg.pdf")
pardef = par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.main=1.5, cex.sub=1.5)
a=plot(school.avg.tauhat, school.pred, cex = 1.5,
     xlim = range(school.avg.tauhat, school.pred),
     ylim = range(school.avg.tauhat, school.pred),
     xlab = "average CATE estimate in school",
     ylab = "school-wise forest predictions")
abline(0, 1, lwd = 2, lty = 2, col = 4)
par = pardef
dev.off()

```

In the section number7, on the first plot I can see the distribution of the histogram doesnt follow a normal distribution, it seem a asymmetric distribution, because the data is grouped to the right. on the second plot, I can see it looks like a asymetric distribution, similar to the first one. The three plot, the distribution follow a normal distribution, because the data is groupd on the middle. The four plot, I can see the estimate CATE go through all the boxplot on x1. The five plot, the estimate CATE go through the boxplot on X2 variable. And finally, the final plot, I can see the linear regression doesnt that does not go through all the points and there are some outlires on the graph.


8. Visualize school-level covariates by treatment heterogeneity
```{r}
school.X.std = scale(school.X)
school.tercile = cut(school.pred,
                     breaks = c(-Inf, quantile(school.pred, c(1/3, 2/3)), Inf))
school.tercile.mat = model.matrix(~ school.tercile + 0)
school.means = diag(1 / colSums(school.tercile.mat)) %*% t(school.tercile.mat) %*% as.matrix(school.X.std)

MM = max(abs(school.means))
HC = heat.colors(21)
school.col = apply(school.means, 1:2, function(aa) HC[1 + round(20 * (0.5 + aa))])

DF.plot = data.frame(tercile=rep(factor(1:3, labels=c("low", "mid", "high")), 9), mean=as.numeric(school.means),
                     feature = factor(rbind(colnames(school.X), colnames(school.X), colnames(school.X))))

ggplot(data = DF.plot, aes(x = feature, y = tercile, fill = mean)) +
    geom_tile() + scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "steelblue") +
    theme(axis.text = element_text(size=12), axis.title = element_text(size=14),
          legend.title = element_text(size=14), legend.text = element_text(size=12)) +
    theme(panel.background = element_blank())
ggsave("tercile_plot.pdf", width = 8, height = 4.5, dpi = 120)

mean(school.X$XC.3)
mean(school.X$XC.3[as.numeric(school.tercile) == 1])

```

In the section number 8, I can say the covariates is higher in cases where X1,x2,x4,X5,XC3.But in the others features, its different, because they are on the range of the medium and low.


9. CATE by school
```{r}
ord = order(order(school.pred))
school.sort = ord[school.id]

pdf("school_boxplot.pdf")
pardef = par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.main=1.5, cex.sub=1.5)
boxplot(tau.hat.noclust ~ school.sort, xaxt = "n",
        xlab = "school", ylab = "estimated CATE")
points(1:76, sort(school.pred), col = 4, pch = 16)
legend("topleft", c("school mean CATE", "CATE w/o clustering"), pch = c(16, 1), col = c(4, 1), cex = 1.5)
par = pardef
dev.off()
```

In this final section, I can see the schoolÂ´s mean is increasing on CATE variable. The CATE represent the clustering and its going for the mayority of the boxplot.
