In this paper, authors try to predict appareal object using Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods. To do so they employ the Hedonic Prices theory and many algorithms to perform accurate predictions.

Authors first describe how is Hedonic prices work. They explain, as we know, that hedonic prices are based on characteristics or features of objects; this has several implications on price indices theory. 

Since hedonic prices are (most of the times) based on observable features we can address them by identifying those features (such as color, brand, description). Here's where AI and ML methods enter. Authors use Embedding techniques to address items descriptions and images to construct categories. After this categorization authors use Neural Networks algorithms to estiamte prices. They construct the network by using just 3 hidden layers.

One wuestion that may arise is why to choose neural nets over other methods. Well, authors try using linear models using some features but the goodness of fit they obtain is poor. Then they try to predict prices using just ML methods and the improve the fitting (even with methods such as Random forest). However, the greatest improvement in predicting prices coems when they combine DL features with ML methods. The best model (based on the goodness of fit '$R^2$') comes with the use of Neural nets using DL features. Using this method they obtain an $R^2$ ranging from  80% to 90% . Finally, authors check the prices indices and they find taht the hedonic prices indices have decreased since 2013.


This article is impressively underestable even when the topics are complex. This is maybe because the real-life application that authors show. This shows us the power of AI and ML methods when combined and its possible uses for future similar works (predicting housing prices, other seasonal prices and so on).
