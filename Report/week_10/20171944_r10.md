The authors elaborate empirical models of hedonic prices, this measuring the changes constumer's welfare. The neural networking method used here tries to imitate the mind of the human being with information-processing tasks. In this way, it tries to collect the key features of the product, this by using $structured sparsity$ to create $parsimonious structures$ to estimate an hedonic price function.

The method follows a process of converting textual information to numeric product features by using ELMO or BERT deep learning methods, with  Amazon's data for first party. Once recollected this data, and with the help of neural networks, the method estimates an hedonic price function. 

Before, to find a low dimensional numerical representation $X_j$ of the key features of the products, investigators depended on another expert to do it. Yet, this approach didn't allowed them to analyze many types of products and also contain some biases. This is why, the neural networking method using AI can maybe replicate this and delivered in a scalable inference without the bias.

The final results proved that hedonic models had high predictive accuracy, with an R around the 80% and 90%. At the end, the authors find that the production of hedonic prices can be automatic and scalable to inference, only using machine learning methods, and that hedonic price models gives a good first-order approximation to prices.
