The authors of this article aim to develop an empirical model of hedonic prices that can predict the prices of the articles making use of the images and texts of the articles on the amazon website and in this way be able to measure the changes in the well-being of the clients. They specifically use deep learning models to develop a model that can transform the information in the images and text of the articles into numerical characteristics, which will then be used to estimate the prices of the articles.

The main strength of this paper is that the hedonic price index generated by the model proposed by the authors does not incur the input / output selection bias problem as other price indices such as the price match index do. What the latter does is to track the changes in prices in a base and later period, but it incurs a problem when new products enter, since they do not have prices in some of the periods. This is known as the entry / exit bias. This bias can be avoided with the model proposed by the authors and is a great advance to later be able to evaluate consumer welfare. In addition, it should be noted that this is quite useful for cases such as those mentioned in the article, in which there is a large rotation of products.

This article really makes a breakthrough in the ways that consumer wellness can be analyzed through the use of neural networks. Although there was already literature on hedonic prices, they did not necessarily make use of deep learning models as the authors do and they also did not necessarily have a high enough precision as in the case of this research, since in the empirical study that is done Regarding the articles on the amazon website between 2013-2017, it is found that the prediction of the proposed model has an R_square of around 80%, which is quite high.

A next step for the development of the use of this new model would be to try to see if the prediction of hedonic prices through the models proposed in this article when it comes to analyzing the articles from different web pages, since the description of these can change according to the website on which it is published. It would be interesting to see how the price prediction changes in this case in this case and thus be able to determine if the use of this model can be used on different web pages at the same time or only on one.
