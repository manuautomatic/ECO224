<p style='text-align: justify;'> The present article aims to develop an empirical model of hedonic prices. Subsequently, develop an index based on this model to evaluate changes in the well-being of individuals and measure inflation (or deflation). The data set it uses is extracted from the clothing category on Amazon for the period from 01/2013 to 11/2018. This data set is made up of the product description and image. Therefore, two different transformation methodologies are applied, for text and image. An important transformation that the article makes is that of prices, these are a ratio between total sales and the total quantity sold in a given month for a product. For the treatment of the description of the products, three different methodologies are presented and comparisons are made. These are Word2Vec, ELMO and BERT, these methods convert the corpus into a vector representation. The first method has a simpler methodology compared to the last two. ElMO and BERT are pre-trained models that have considerable mathematical complexity. The main difference between these is manifested in the consideration of the context, use of subwords and adjustments in pesos. Therefore, the methodology that will be used will depend on the type of description. On the other hand, for the treatment of the images, the author uses the ResNet50 methodology. This is a pre-trained model that can be used to obtain the vector transformation of images. To carry out this transformation, it uses convolutional neural networks. After the transformation and processing of the data, a multitasking neural network is used, trained to predict prices, to produce the hedonic price function. The results of this model are compared with other estimation methods (linear model, random forest and Single-Task Neural Network). Favorable results are found, the Multi-Task Neural Network has an R2 between 80% and 90%. This result is higher compared to the other models. Using this model and results, he estimates a price index to evaluate inflation.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> The contributions of the author are the empirical application, presentation of a new (revolutionary) approach to assess inflation (or deflation) and simple and intuitive presentation of the different transformation techniques for images and text. The document could have had more impact on the publication of the programming codes, this fact has already been seen in other previous documents. On the other hand, I consider that the article opens an interesting line of research on the treatment of inflation (or deflation) that radically changes the current approach of macroeconomists. Also, the application has been severely reduced, since it only uses one category of products. This fact opens up new thematic lines of evaluation for the other product categories and in different countries. The latter represents the points where the document or literature should advance.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> In short, it is a very interesting and quite constructive article in a new vision about the estimation of prices and inflation.
