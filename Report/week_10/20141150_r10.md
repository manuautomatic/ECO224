<p align="justify"> In principle, the achievement of this paper is that they developed empirical models of hedonic prices for measuring the changes in customers’ welfare. They use hedonic prices to estimate the rates of deflation for the aggregate baskets of apparel products that customers buy at Amazon. As these models are based on the hedonic prices’ perspective, and as they use images and descriptions of apparel on e-commerce platforms, as well as they establish a particular process of neural-networks-embeddings conversion of these sources which transform moderately high-dimensional information to low-dimensional numeric data (taking advantage of “structured sparsity”), with certain frequencies of measurement, there are implied construction considerations in this process which allows to state that the research question could be stated as the following: How can we, via deep learning methods, build a price index which is based on characteristics of the products —rather than on the nomination of the products themselves—, precise, scalable to many types of products, robust to biases due to products turnover between periods, and automatic?

<p align="justify"> The strengths of this paper can be segmented into three categories, namely those regarding their tipologization effort to place their proposals in the state of the art, those associated to the sequentiality of their explanations, and those related to the schematization of the contents they present. On their tipologization effort, the authors constantly establish comparisons between their proposals and the other state-of-the-art advances on the fields their analysis goes through (i.e., prices indices, price prediction, and massive data management). For example, when the authors introduce hedonic prices as an alternative input to construct new price indices, they compare the hedonic price indices with matched price indices. As another example, when the authors address the conversion of image and text data (i.e., image and text embeddings), they compare, for text data management, the Word2Vec algorithm with ELMO and BERT algorithms, and ultimately compare the ELMO and BERT algorithms. These comparisons allow readers to build a mental map of how the authors’ proposal lies in the knowledge on price indexing, prediction, and inference. Regarding their results, they even communicate empirical observations by comparing distinct indices. On the explanation sequence, they construct, the authors portrait a well-organized sequence for the explanation of their analysis, which starts with the adoption of the basis theory for the construction of their price indices (i.e., hedonic theory), then goes onto the characterization of the insertion of hedonic prices in price indices. After that, they explain how they represent the product information via Neural Network (NN) embeddings. And, finally, they examine the quality and nature of their results. On to the schematization of the contents they present, the authors attempt to tackle the technical complexity of the underlying rationale of the several statistical-mathematical structures they build, as well as that of the deep learning methods they present. They use several graphics to this end and point-by-point-like statements to add didacticism to this paper. Moreover, they offer appendices with more detailed information. Finally, they explain their results in a succinct way, using the already mentioned tools.

<p align="justify"> The authors themselves state that they view their paper as “developing major modernization of both hedonic price models as well as their application to large data”
In sum, they expand the knowledge in the following areas:
The measurement of prices is based on the conception of a product as a set of characteristics (for which they use hedonic theory).
The management of large data for creating features to measure inflation, in a context in which the analyzed products present a significant turnover (entry and exit) between periods. 
The automatization of inflation measurement. 

<p align="justify"> Finally, one next step to answer the research, the question is to replicate this process in larger goods available on the internet. On the other hand, this paper makes a contribution to empirical microeconomics, from the vision of an economist, neural networks could test some classic assumptions of microeconomics. (i.e. price rigidity of goods on the internet). The use of neural networks is a field of study that is still little explored in economics.
