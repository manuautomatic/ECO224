# Report 10: Hedonic prices and quality adjusted price indices powered by AI.
 
Cen et al (2021) generate empirical model of hedonic prices to measure the impact of prices in welfare using Neural Network (NNs) and, in order to do this, generate features from text and images and use them to estimate hedonic price functions. This is based on the assumptions that prices can be defined by the characteristics of a product and the existence of parsimonious structures behind text and images. This methods aim to avoid "structured sparsity", that is when human criteria lowers the dimensionality of images and texts by reducing its definition to simple variables. The information used its extracted from Amazon. 

So, first, this paper transform text and images to numeric features using Deep Learning models (specifically, NNs models such as ELMO or BERT). It's important to note that compared to traditional models, the networks used fot text or images have low dimensional intermediate hidden layers. This same type of models, NNs, are used to estimate the hedonic price functions. In this ones, the output layer contains all the predicted hedonic prices in all periods. They have a high $R^2$, meaning that they have a high predictive accuracy for various products. By comparing the hedonic prices calculated, between 2013-2017 we can see the decrease of the price index. This means that there has been an increase in the welfare of the Amazon's customers welfare.  

One of the strenghts of this paper is that uses complex models such as NNs in order to avoid subjectivity and make use of all the information available online. As is well-know, NNs represent not only a revolution to computer sciense, but also to other disciplines, such as Economics. This papers sets a presedent to solve another econometric problems (hedonics prices) that have been reduced before due to the absence of powerful tools, as well as measuring original non-numeric features (Images and texts).

Nevertheless, the paper has its own limitations as well. We can find that , at least at estimating the hedonic price function, they do not compare their result from another simple models, such as Lasso or a Random Forest. They find that its accuracy is high (80%-90%), however there's no proof that this other simple but potent models could have a higher accuracy. Even if this models can't process images and text, they could be useful to compared the estimation of the processed numeric features.

This paper advanced knowledge because it makes use of adavanced and complex methods to create non-estimated-before features and solve econometric problems which answer was biased before due to human subjectivity. It leaves a presendent and marks a new branch of studies that can be made in Economics. Apart from that, the paper could be improved by comparing, at least the estimation of hedonic price functions, to other simple but good models that can helps us understand (if true) how much better NNs models work.
