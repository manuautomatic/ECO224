## Paper: : Bajari, Patrick L. et al. (2021). *Hedonic prices and quality adjusted price indices powered by AI*

### Student: Alexander Pacheco (20161901)

The authors present an empirical approach to estimate hedonic prices and find changes in customer welfare. To do this, they use large data generated by neural network. The observations are characteristics of the products converted into numbers through ELMO or BERT and ResNet50 to be anzalyzed. They took Amazon data to predict hedonic clothing prices using characteristics and preferences of customers.

The strength of this paper is that the method used by the authors is not based on classical models in which economic variables such as previous prices, GDP, among others, but rather uses observable characteristics of the product to predict hedonic prices. However, the weakness is that it may not be able to be used for all types of goods such as some services.

La contribution de este paper es que presenta una nueva aplicación  para las redes neuronales en la investigación económica y establece un precedente para futuras investigaciones.

The next steps should be to apply this methodology to different types of products and deduce for which and what type of sectors are the ones that best fit this proposed model.
