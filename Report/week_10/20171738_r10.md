Economists have measured how consumers are affected by price changes in the economic environment, and have developed several tools to do this. One of the most commonly used are price indices, such as the Laspeyeres, Paasch or Fisher indices. However, a common problem with these indices is product entry and exit, where the previous period's prices are not available for new products and vice-versa. To overcome this issue, several methods have been developed through history, one of the is hedonic prices, which summarize the relationship between the prices and the characteristics of goods sold in differentiated products. Moreover, hedonic theory suggests that we can learn hedonic price functions by estimating regression functions that explain observed prices in terms of products characteristics.

So, I consider that the authors' research question is the next one: is it posible to estimate adquately hedonic prices and hedonic indices by the use of neural network models ? To show th answer properly, let's resume the steps carried out by the authors:

* 1° The authors try to generate product attributes or features (from text description and images) by deep learning use them to estimate the hedonic price function, utilizing modern machine learning methods. With that purpose in mind, the authors estimate the arguments that will be used by the model. So, we have to estimate the text argument, the authors employ, they convert the text information about the product to numeric product features using the ELMO or BERT neural network model. And for the case of the other charactheristic, the authors convert the product image to numerical product features by a pre-trained ResNet50 neural network model.

* 2° After having obtained the above elements, the authors use neural networks again to produce the estimated hedonic price function, which summarize the relationship between the prices and the characteristics of goods sold in differentiated products:

* Which is trained by minimizing the next loss function:

<div align="center">

* 3° In the first expression showed, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H_%7Bit%7D"> equates to the hedonic price function, which summarizes the relationship between the prices and the characteristics of goods sold in differentiated products. So, according to the authors, to be estimated it needs as arguments the "product attributes", for which the following function is used:

* 4° Then, it is possible to estimate the hedonic prices thanks to the NN model last layer, which provides us with the "value embeddings" <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=V_%7Bit%7D%20%3D%20(V_%7B1t%7D%2C...%2CV_%7Bpt%7D)%5E%7B%5Cprime%7D">. So, all the estimated data is used to estimate the following expression:

<div align="center">

* This is a regresion model where by obtaning the estimates <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Chat%7B%5Cbeta%7D_t"> it is posible to obtain the estimated hedonic price:

* 5° Finally, the authors proceed to construct hedonic Fisher price indices (HFPI) over 2013-2017, constructing a monthly and yearly chainedindices, for which they use the following expression: 

<div align="center">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R_t%5E%7BGF%2CH%7D%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7BR_%7Bt%2Cl%7D%5E%7BF%2CH%2CC%7D%20%5Ccdot%20R_%7Bt%2C12%7D%5E%7BF%2CH%2CC%7D%20%7D"> </div>

 * for which it was necessary to previously find both arguments using the following expression:

<div align="center">

![image7](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?R^{F,H,C}_{t,l}&space;=&space;\prod\limits_{\bar{m}=1}^{m}&space;R^{F,H}_{\bar{m},l})  </div>

* where each element of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cprod_%7B%5Cbar%7Bm%7D%3D1%7D%5E%7Bm%7D%20R%5E%7BF%2CH%7D_%7B%5Cbar%7Bm%7D%2Cl%7D%20"> is built using the Paasche and Fisher index, both in their optimized version presented in the paper.

Having mentioned all that before, I would say that the article's strengths are the next ones. The first one would be the authors provide una conscisa theoretical explanation of the proposed approach and the steps to be followed to arrive at the estimation of hedonic prices and the construction of hedonic price indexes .The second one would be that it not only explains the algorithm, it also presents the results of an application of the hedonic price models using real data: the Amazon data for first-party apparel sales; whose results showed that the neural network models have better out-of-sample predictive performance than, for example, a tree-based method, with a predictive accuracy ranging in [ 80%,90% ].
 
That being said, the main contribution of this article —from my perspective— is that it can be seen as a major developing modernization of hedonic price models in modern times, as well as how to apply these new methods to a large data set. This can serve not only academic purposes, but is also made to the literature regarding alternative tools for inflation measurement with which to measure how consumers are affected by price changes in the economic environment.

Finally, important challenges or steps to be added in future works who want to follow the article's path would be the next ones: a) use the apporach followed in the article with multiple an different numer of datasets that come from different institutions in different countries, all this to be able to observe both the robustness of the proposed algorithm and to see how fierce the results obtained from the official results published by government institutions are; and b) develop further mathematical development to establish a way to determine the apprpiate number of hidden layers and neurons to be used in the algorithm process.
