Although the indexes allow us to observe changes in prices, they have a limitation because they cannot correctly measure the entry and exit of products, so indexes were created that followed a hedonic function, which placed a price according to the characteristics of the product. The authors are looking for new hedonic models based on deep learning to correctly estimate prices and thus be able to build correct indexes that can correctly estimate the change in consumer welfare in the face of price increases.

The strength of the paper is that in addition to building an index with the new hedonic model, it compares it with commonly used indexes such as Fisher prices index (HFPI), Jevons Index, CPI and DPI to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Another strength of the paper is that the data used comes from Amazon, which is a site where products are constantly updated, which tests the hedonic model built, as well as the indexes that are built through these prices. Finally, the paper also explains how the hedonic model is constructed and how the ELMO and Restener50 models work for the construction of the embeddings that will allow estimating the prices. 

Unlike previous models that only allowed a low-dimensional input, now thanks to the contribution of the authors, it is possible to work with high-dimensional space information such as images, this is achieved through models such as ELMO and BERT (Deep learning models), Restner50 to build the embeddings. This process also allows to avoid the judgment bias that could previously occur by experts when producing low-dimensional representations of the characterized ones of a product to build the hedonic models, because now the representations are made through Deep learning models. Moreover, thanks to these new hedonic models based on neural network, it is possible to correctly build a real-time index that correctly measures inflation, which can be used by the government for the construction of public policies.
 
A next step in this area is to incorporate more limited databases and compare the performance of the indexes built through hedonic models with other indexes. In addition, the model should be adapted in developing countries where it is not easy to incorporate a database such as amazon's because most of the products consumed are not digitally traded, which would limit its use for the construction of an index that correctly measures inflation.
