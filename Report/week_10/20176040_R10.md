Title: Hedonic prices and quality adjusted price indices powered by AI

The authors, with the intention of measuring changes in people's welfare, estimate empirical models of hedonic prices based on deep learning. To put this in context, the authors mention that one of the great challenges for economists is to measure how economic variations (prices of the goods we usually consume) affect people's welfare, which is why they usually use price indexes that are well known in microeconomics (Laspayres, Paasche, Fisher). In this case they chose to try something more novel based on the hedonic approach (based on observable characteristics), the main advantage of which is that it allows new goods to be compared with old goods in a fairly direct way; they simply compare the value that consumers place on the characteristics of the old good with those of the new one. Then, they use deep neural network methods, the key component of which is the generation of product features using neural network (NN) embeddings of text and image information about the product. So in the end, it shows the utility of hedonic models for characterizing prices and we document the decline of the quality-adjusted Fisher price index in the apparel sector. 

The paper has mainly two important contributions to using hedonic price index through deep neural networks: (i) it develops an important modernization of both hedonic price models and their application to large-scale data. Thus, it contributes to the empirical microeconomics literature devoted to hedonic price models and their uses in inflation measurement and (ii) it contributes to an artificial intelligence literature by giving it new ways of use. Moreover, it itself contributes to the search for techniques that more accurately estimate changes in consumer welfare. 

Next steps may include using the same technique but perhaps on other products that may more directly affect people's welfare, especially those with more limited resources (products such as houses).
