Hedonic prices and quality adjusted price indices powered by AI

Report 10

The effect of price changes on consumer welfare has been a fundamental problem. Thus, this paper tries to solve this problem using hedeonic price models. In addition, they derive hedonic price indices so that they can measure client welfare changes based on learning. Laspeyeres or Paasch indices can be used, but these indices are not good for new products, of which there is no previous price. In this way, hedeonic prices are used to be able to save the previous characteristics. These characteristics, that is, textual information of the product, convert it to numerical characteristics of the product using ELMO or BERT language models. These language models. These models are adjusted by Amazon product descriptions. The image model used is ResNet50. Neural network (NN) are then used to produce the hedeonic functions.
The paper is divided into 5 parts. In the first three they define the hedonic price indices; discuss the estimates of the hedeonic price functions through the NN and describe the engineering used to develop this process. In the next section, they examine performance by the method they have developed. Finally, they compare the hedeonic index with the others.
The most striking thing about the paper is how they use artificial intelligence to be able to develop a model that explains the effect of price changes on people using the characteristics of the product.
