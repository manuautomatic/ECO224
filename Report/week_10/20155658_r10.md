In the last decade, Neural Networks have received particular interest as a data mining technology, because it offers the resources to model effectively and efficiently large and complex problems. Neural network models are driven from data, that is, they are capable of inductively find relationships (patterns) through existing data-based learning algorithms rather than requiring help of a modeler to specify the functional form and their interactions. Neural networks are a method of solving problems, individually or combined with other methods, for those tasks of classification, identification, diagnosis, optimization or prediction in which the data/knowledge balance incline towards the data and where, additionally, there may be a need for learning and some fault tolerance. For this reason, an empirical application in the prediction of hedonic prices with the use of neural networks will be explained below. The article to deal with is titled “Hedonic Prices and Quality Adjusted Price Indices Powered by AI”, which their authors are Bajari, P. L., Cen, Z., Chernozhukov, V., Manukonda, M., Wang, J., Huerta, R., ... & Wan, S. 

First of all, I will begin by stating the goal of the authors' research. The authors try to answer the question: What is the usefulness of neural networks for predicting the hedonic prices of apparels offered on the Amazon platform?

Secondly, I will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the article's approach to answer the research question.

On the one hand, one of the main strengths of the article is that, in the first place, it describes in detail all the concepts to understand about the measurement of inflation (the different indices that exist: IPC, Laspeyeres, Fisher, Paasch, Jevons), about the models used to convert in quantifiable quantities the text used in the advertisements (ELMO and BERT models), on the model used to convert the images used in the advertisements into quantifiable quantities (ResNet50 model) and, specially, on the model of multi- task neural networks to predict prices of apparels offered on Amazon. It is very important to fully understand each of the models used in the article and the author is diligent in explaining these concepts both intuitively and mathematically.

In addition, one of the article's strengths is that when using multi-task neural networks to predict the prices of apparels offered on the Amazon platform out of sample, it also predicts these prices out of sample through other models such as the linear regression model, random forest, single neural networks and, consequently, compares how close the estimated data are to the real ones (R squared).

Moreover, another of the article's strengths is that the multi-task neural network model can be adapted to other large-scale databases, since -precisely- they predict better minewhile the greater the number of observations are.

On the other hand, one of the weaknesses of the article is that, when calculating hedonic price indices, the prices of apparels products are contrasted with the prices of those same products sold at a different time. However, this can lead to selection biases (since there may be some products that enter or exit more frequently than others). In addition, there may be sets of apparels products that are small, that is, not representative to be able to predict properly.

Thirdly, the contribution of this article is the use of modern methods like machine learning and artificial intelligence models to measure inflation and other variables such as the characteristics of the product, these are: text, image, inputs to produce it and others. The contribution of this new model extensively addresses the empirical microeconomics literature specifically to hedonic pricing models.

Finally, since one of the weaknesses of the article is that, when calculating hedonic price indices, the prices of apparels products are contrasted with the prices of those same products sold at a different time. And this can generate selection biases (since there may be some products that enter or exit more frequently than others). And that in addition, there may be sets of apparels products that are small, that is, not representative to be able to predict adequately. A next challenge to advance in the research question is that an algorithm can be created that can weight the number of observations of each particular product in time, that is, if in case these are very few such observations, then they can be multiply or use methods to get the same number of observations in order to eliminate selection bias.
