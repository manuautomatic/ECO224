## HEDONIC PRICES AND QUALITY ADJUSTED PRICE INDICES POWERED BY AI

The author tries to expose his approach to hedonic pricing. According to the article's approach, hedonic prices are generated with the purpose of measuring customer welfare, attributes or characteristics of the products that consumers consume are generated. Hedonic price functions summarize the relationship between prices and characteristics of goods sold in differentiated products. All of the above is done through state-of-the-art deep learning models that are then used to estimate the hedonic price function. Specifically, text information about the product is converted into numerical characteristics using the ELMO or BERT deep learning models. In turn, the ELMO model predicts the next word from previous words, while the BERT model is trained on two self-supervised tasks simultaneousl

One of the strengths of this article  the empirical review it performs, this article works with facts of everyday life, such as buying clothes online. All this in order to analyze how consumer behavior varies according to different types of goods consumed and then compare their hedonic prices.

Also, one of the main purposes of this paper is to develop the modernization of both hedonic price models and their application to large-scale data. In this way, it contributes to a better development of the empirical microeconomic literature whose use is in the measurement of inflation. In addition, this paper contributes to a rapidly growing literature on the use of alternative, modern techniques and data to measure inflation and other aggregate quantities.

Further, when comparing the hedonic model and normal models, the hedonic model allows comparing new products with old products, thus comparing the value that consumers attribute to the characteristics of the old good with those of the new one. In addition, hedonic approaches are useful for predicting the prices of new goods and dealing with entry/exit selection bias when product prices are undefined.
